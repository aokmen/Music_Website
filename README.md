## Description:

* This is an HTML code that creates a web page with a navbar and content. The navbar includes a logo and links to different pages. The content section includes a heading and an image. The image acts as a button that plays a song when clicked.

* The CSS code styles the elements of the HTML page. It sets the background image, font, colors, and positioning of the elements. It also creates a hover effect for the links in the navbar.

* The JavaScript code uses the HTML audio element to play a song when the image is clicked. It also changes the image source from play to pause and vice versa when the song is played or paused.
